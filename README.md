# p5.js Notebook

With the p5.js Notebook extension for Visual Studio Code you can create notebooks in Visual Studio Code that run p5.js code.

After installing the extension you can create a new file with the file-ending `.p5js` and start working in your notebook.

## How does it work?

A notebook documents works like JavaScript code that is executed in a HTML file. That means, you cannot redefine variables in the file and you can override functions and variables in code cells later on.

If you execute a specific cell, all cells upon to this cell will be executed but not further. That means it works differently compared to regular Jupyter notebooks where you can run cells in any order and execute a single cell only.
